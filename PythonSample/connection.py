"""
    Deezer ``connection`` module for NativeSDK
    ==========================================

    Manage connection operation with the REST API and the connection info.

    This is a part of the Python wrapper for the NativeSDK. This module wraps
    the deezer-connect functions into several python classes. The calls to the
    C lib are done using ctypes.

    Globals
    -------

    libdeezer: The lib object loaded to perform the function calls to the C SDK
    *_func types: C func types declared to translate python functions to
        callbacks when required. See section Callback types below.

    Content summary
    ---------------

    The class used to manage connection is the Connection class. The others
    describe C enums to be used in callbacks (see below) and logs.

    Callback types
    --------------

    A bunch of this module's functions use callbacks to react to some
    connection events or to process some data. you are free to pass your funcs
    as callbacks, they are then translated to C functions and passed to the SDK
    functions. Here is a description of their parameters:

        dz_connect_on_event_cb:
        Called after connection activation and when the connection state
        changes.
        The callback must take 3 parameters:
        -   The connection handle (same as Connection.connect_handle)
        -   An event object used to get the event that has been caught. In your
            callback, use the static method get_event to convert the event
            object to a ConnectionEvent index.
        -   A user_data that is an object you can pass through some functions
            and that can be manipulated by the callback.

        dz_activity_operation_cb:
        Can be set in some functions of Connection class to be called after
        the operation.
        The callback must take 4 parameters:
        -   A delegate that is the context object to store and change
            info in the callback.
        -   An operation_userdata that is the object you can pass to
            the calling function
        -   The error status used to get the index of the error enum
        -   An event object used to get the event that has been caught

        dz_connect_crash_reporting_delegate:
        Takes nothing an returns a boolean.
        Use this to call your own crash reporting system. If left to None, the
        SDK will use its own crash reporting system (Breakpad).
